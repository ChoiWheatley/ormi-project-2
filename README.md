## Watch Out! This is just a TOY PROJECT! âœ‹

This is not intended as production! It has only default django security solution such as password hashing and authentication.

## Requirements

- Start project with static files from [base repo](https://github.com/weniv/BackendOrmi/tree/main/HTML-CSS/board_final).
- \[optional\] You can customize from [this front-end template](https://weniv.github.io/react-blog/).
- Implement view architectures using Classy Views
- Don't use DRF. Build monolithic web app
